## -j 4 It will enable Multi-core
## -a we can give regular 3â€™ adapter like "CTGTAGGCACCATCAAT" which is clipped from the 3' end.
## -q 25 Used to trim low-quality ends from reads before adapter removal.
## --minimum-length 25 Will discard processed reads that are shorter than LENGTH 25 and reads which are too short before adapter removal are also discarded. 
## --discard-untrimmed  in this option the read is to be trimmed only if all required adapters were found.
## # Clipping 3' adapter.
